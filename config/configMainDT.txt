# This file defines the configuration parameters for glider toolbox in delayed mode 
# processing by main_glider_data_processing_dt. Users can add any parameter 
# of the configuration to overwrite the default values. For detailed information
# about the available parameters refer to the configTemplate.txt template. 
# Comments may be used by adding a # at the beginning of the line. 
#
# Do not change the processing_mode value (equal to dt) of this configuration 
# since it is used mainly by the delayed mode processing script. 
#
# Edit the data paths and the database information according to your needs.

# Processing mode

    processing_mode = dt 

########################
# Paths to local and public data
#   By default data will be processed locally in glider_data folder
#   If you would like to change the path for the output products you should
#   define the following variable:
#
#        local_paths.base_dir = /path/to/local/folders
#
#   The glider toolbox also provides functionality to copy data to a public area
#   By definining the following variables you define the filesystem path where
#   the netcdf are copied, where the figures are copied and the url that will
#   be input in the json refering to the figures. This is mainly used in the infrastructure
#   of SOCIB and is a very specific need that is likely not necessary by the general user.
#
#        public_paths.base_dir          = /path/to/public/folders
#        public_paths.base_url          = http://your.public.url/path/to/data
#        public_paths.base_html_dir     = /your/public/url/path/to/data


#########################
# Database
#   By default the glider toolbox does not use a database. In other words, the active parameter
#   is turned off. Refer to the Quickstart manual for details. If you would like to use it
#   you can define the necessary values for the db_access configuration as follow:
#
#        db_access.active    = 1
#        db_access.server    = jdbc:postgresql://mydb.myportal.mydomain:5433/my_data_base
#        db_access.name      = my_data_base
#        db_access.user      = db_user
#        db_access.pass      = top_secret
#        db_access.driver    = org.postgresql.Driver
#
#   We recommend that you use a referenced file to define private variables since this configuration
#   file is copied with the data to allow tracking the configuration for specific products.
#   You can create a file with the above values and add the following line to this file
#
#        db_access.fconfig   = /path/to/private/file
